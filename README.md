PLEASE READ THIS!!!

Assesment for innovectives group internship.

For this i made use of react and nothing else basically.
The assets are divided into icons and images, most of the sections of the page are placed in seperate components and yeah let's have a fun time bringing this design to life.

NOTE THIS PLEASE!!

1. The folder structure i used in the project is not the ideal way to go about it, should have a pages and components seperately but it felt like an overkill for something simple like this.

2. Some of the code conventions used was just to speed up the proces of getting this done, other times, better approaches would be used. An example is in how images and the data under them are called. ideally i'd have put them in json file or a js file as an object and just map rather than how i did it here.

3. This project is not a full assessment of what i can really do. I ran into an issue with my system and i ended up using my Father's to get this done but i'm certain by the time you are reading this i'd have gotten my system fixed. I'm not using this as an excuse but I hope you'll also see reason.

4. I am still a junior developer, please keep in mind while you go through this.

5. Also this is optimized for the screen size shown in the design and laptop screens generally, I did not bother with responsiveness because there was no desgin for it and also because of the reason stated in number 3 and 2 as well.

6. Thank you!.
